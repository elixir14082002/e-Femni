  Talking about FIRST PERIODS, it might come as a surprise to someone, 
  especially those who are not addressed with a proper period talk.
  Periods are a sign of the end of puberty. It is the first step of womanhood. 

  
  WHAT IS A PERIOD?
  
  Period is the release of blood and tissues from a female's uterus, 
  out through the vagina. This process is called menstruation.


  WHAT CAUSES PERIODS?

  A period happens because of hormonal changes in the body. 
  Hormones are chemical messengers. The ovaries release the female 
  hormones estrogen and progesterone  These hormones cause the lining 
  of the uterus (or womb) to build up. Every month a woman's body goes 
  through in preparation for the possibility of pregnancy. If there is no 
  fertilized egg, the lining breaks down and bleeds. If the egg is 
  fertilized by a sperm cell, it attaches to the wall of the uterus, where 
  over time it develops into a baby. If the egg is not fertilized, the 
  uterus lining breaks down and bleeds, causing a period.Then the same 
  process happens all over again. This is also called the menstrual cycle.


  WHEN DO MOST GIRLS GET THEIR PERIOD?

  Most girls start their periods when they are 12. They can get from age of 
  10 to 15 years. Every girl's body has its own schedule.


  HOW LONG DOES PERIOD LAST?

  Periods usually last about 5 days. But a period can be shorter or 
  last longer depending on person to person and their menstrual cycle.


  Should I Use a Pad, Tampon, or Menstrual Cup?

  Females have choices to deal with period blood. You may need to 
  experiment a bit to find which works best for you. Some girls use only 
  one method and others switch between different methods.

  Most girls use pads when they first get their period. Pads are made of 
  cotton and come in lots of different sizes and shapes. They have sticky 
  strips that attach to the underwear.
  Many girls find tampons more convenient than pads, especially when playing 
  sports or swimming. A tampon is a cotton plug that a girl puts into her vagina. 
  Most tampons come with an applicator that guides the tampon into place. The 
  tampon absorbs the blood. Don't leave a tampon in for more than 8 hours because 
  this can increase your risk of a serious infection called toxic shock syndrome.
  Some girls prefer a menstrual cup. Most menstrual cups are made of silicone. 
  To use a menstrual cup, a girl inserts it into her vagina. It holds the blood
  until she empties it.

  Will I Have Periods for the Rest of My Life?
  
  When women are around age 45-55, they stop having periods 
  (this is called menopause). Women also won't have a period while they are 
  pregnant.
