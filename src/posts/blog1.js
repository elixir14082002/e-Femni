  In today's world, we have heard about PCO/PCOS/PCOD, at least once in our
  lives. PCO or PCOD or PCOS is one of the most commonly searched women health 
  topics. Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, also known as PCOS, is an extremely common 
  hormonal disorder. In India, almost two in every ten females suffer from PCOS. 
  Fairly enough, PCOS is referred to as the new gynecological epidemic. It is 
  evident that awareness of PCOS or PCOD is increasing among the masses, 
  But are we actually aware of this disease?


  INTRODUCTION

  PCO- Polycystic Ovary or PCOS- Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome or PCOD- Polycystic 
  ovarian disease are one and the same thing on a primary level. When disease is 
  just limited to the ovaries its called PCO or Polycystic Ovary, but when it starts 
  showing its effect on other body-parts in terms of hypertension, high blood sugar, 
  obesity, sleep apnea and many more then it is called as PCOS or Polycystic Ovarian 
  Syndrome. 50% of PCOS patients go undiagnosed. 50% of PCOS patients are at high 
  risk of type2 diabetes. These are very alarming statistics and we need to understand 
  PCOS and treat the disease well!


  SYMPTOMS

  Certain symptoms of PCOS are well-heard of, let's take a deeper look into these:
    -> IRREGULAR PERIOD CYCLE: This is one of the major symptoms of PCO. Patients 
       might experience irregular periods, delayed periods or early periods, 
       scanty periods or prolonged periods.
    -> WEIGHT MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS: Patients finding difficulty in gaining or 
       losing weight. This signifies male pattern hormone excess in their body
    -> SIGNS OF MALE PATTERN HORMONE EXCESS: Excess facial hair, scalp hair loss, 
       increased body hair, more fat accumulation near the stomach, husky voice, acne.
    -> INFERTILITY: Some of the females suffering from PCO are not able to 
       conceive naturally.
    -> SLEEP DISTURBANCES: Some patients find trouble falling asleep at night. 
       They might show symptoms of sleep apnea. They find it difficult to sleep at times. 
       They might wake up in the middle of the night and might face day-time sleepiness. 
    -> MOOD SWINGS: Studies show that females having PCO also show signs of mood swings, 
       anxiety, depression.
  Females showing any 2 or 3 of the symptoms should get in touch with their Gynecologist.
  Early identification of PCO along with right knowledge can decrease the risk of many 
  other problems.


  CAUSES

  PCO is a lifestyle disorder. Knowing the causes of PCO and prevention of it can 
  reduce the chances of risks.
    -> INSULIN RESISTANCE: The main culprit among all causes is Insulin resistance. 
       Insulin is a hormone secreted by the pancreas. The purpose of insulin is to 
       pick glucose from the blood and use it in the form of energy in the various 
       parts of the body. 
       In pco patients, somehow insulin is not able to do its job, the cells are 
       not able to pick the glucose from the blood. In compensation to this, the 
       body produces more and more insulin which leads to high insulin levels in 
       the body. These high insulin levels then in turn stimulate the ovaries to 
       become bulkier and produce abnormal hormones, leading to these problems in 
       the body.
    -> SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE: Humans were not supposed to have a sedentary lifestyle, 
       having an active lifestyle with at least 30 minutes of movement or 150 min of 
       workout per week is essential for a human body in general.
    -> DIETS: One of the important factors is food. In today's world people eat 
       food to satisfy their taste buds, not their nutritional requirement.
    -> STRESS: Stress plays an important role in the period cycle. Great amount of 
       stress can also be one of the reasons for delayed periods.
    -> SLEEP CYCLE: As we all know that PCO is a hormonal issue. We should know 
       that hormones are regulated by our body cycle. 8 hours of sleep plays an 
       important role in the well-being of a person.


  PREVENTIONAL STEPS/LIFESTYLE CHANGES

    -> DIET: It is the entire approach and the philosophy around diet, which 
       is important to achieve good health. Once you learn what to eat, how much 
       to eat, when to eat, how to cook, the food starts to work for you . So 
       think long term, invest in learning the philosophy around the food, not 
       just a single diet.  As they say, "Eat your food as medicine otherwise, 
       you will have to eat medicines as food". 
    -> EXERCISE: Food and exercise go hand in hand. Being physically active 
       is the best thing you can do for reversing PCOD.  It keeps your body strong 
       and mind happy and resilient. Exercise can be in any form, either yoga or high 
       intensity interval training or cardio- anything that you find sustainable in 
       the long term.
    -> SLEEP: We already know that 30% of PCOD patients have difficulties in 
       sleeping. It can either be sleeping problems that cause PCOD or PCOD that 
       causes sleeping problems.  A good night's sleep is now scientifically proven 
       to improve endocrine function, especially PCOD. We should not compromise our 
       sleep and work consciously towards improving the sleep quality.
